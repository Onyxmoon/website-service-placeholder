# Service Placeholder

Simple status page that I use across different domains for services that don't need a full website.

## What it does

- Shows operational status with animated indicator
- Displays current UTC time 
- Shows page load time
- Automatically detects and displays the domain it's running on
- Works without JavaScript but enhanced when available

## Structure

- `index.html` - Single file with everything embedded
- `fonts/space-grotesk/` - Custom font files and CSS
- `robots.txt` - Blocks search engine crawling
- `favicon.ico` - Basic favicon

No build process needed, just static HTML.
